design a web-based Tutoring Calendar App using the following color palette and the existing layout structure:

Color Palette:

Teal: #6DB8D0

Yellow: #FBC85F

Navy: #3E4E88

Coral: #F87C73

Light Blue Gradient: #D2EBF4 → #B4DFEC

Light Pink Gradient: #FFDAD9 → #FFC4C3

Light Yellow Gradient: #FFE FCE → #FFEABD

Overall Goal:
Keep the same structure and layout as a standard calendar/events dashboard, but restyle it for a tutoring service. Use friendly, modern UI patterns with soft rounded corners, subtle shadows, and accessible typography.

Design Requirements
1. Header

Clean white header with slight shadow.

Left: calendar icon inside a small colored circle (teal or navy).

Title text: “Tutoring Sessions”.

Tabs: “Events” and “Calendar” as pill-shaped buttons.

Right: “New Session” button in coral (#F87C73) with rounded edges.

2. Page Sections

Section title: Upcoming Sessions

Below that: a vertically stacked list of session cards.

Another section titled Completed Sessions with lightly dimmed styling.

Use soft background washes with the gradients (very subtle, 5–10% opacity).

3. Event / Session Cards

Design each card as a rounded tile with:

Large session title in navy.

Subject label (e.g., Math, Science) as a small colored tag.

Date and time row with icons.

Timezone badge as a small rounded capsule.

Student/tutor emails displayed as small pill chips.

Primary action button: “Join Session” — coral, rounded, with a video icon.

Left accent bar or colored dot:

Teal → academic subjects

Yellow → planning/homework review

Coral → exam prep or urgent sessions

Shadow: soft, modern, subtle.

4. New Session Modal (Form)

Keep the same structure but adjust wording:

Session Title / Subject

Start Date & Time

End Date & Time

Student Emails (up to 5)

Tutor Name (optional)

Styled with:

Light blue or yellow gradient header band

White form body

Coral submit button

5. Style Personality

Use rounded shapes everywhere (rounded-xl or rounded-2xl feel).

Add small decorative circles or blobs using yellow, teal, and navy.

Use a modern sans-serif font, soft whitespace, and friendly spacing.

Maintain an educational, warm, student-friendly aesthetic.

Tone of the UI
